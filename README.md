# Weather-Journal App Project

An asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. It is focus on learning Web APIs fetching and asynchrous functions for the Front End Nanodegree for Udacity, project 3. We are viewing some basic content for the nanodegree. We will keep things easy and on the future I will create some branches or side projects with more advanced functionalities for builing some independant courses for my mentoring sessions.
